# BezierCurves
Testing Bezier Curves in Unity.

This was the method I used for the jump rope object in the mobile games I made, "Jump Rope Boy" and "Jump Rope Girl".
Those games have been removed from the iOS and Android app stores, and I do not have the rights to distribute them, but I wanted to demonstrate how I implemented the jump rope in Unity.
